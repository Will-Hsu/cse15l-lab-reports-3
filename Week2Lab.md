- I am on MacOS so I did not have to install OpenSSH, but I did have to prepare my course-specific account for CSE 15L by resetting the password.
- I connected to the server through my local device with $ssh cs15lsp22akz@ieng6.ucsd.edu.
- I had to answer some simple questions and ended up getting connected as shown in the screenshot above.
